A Python `.whl` file for `nemo2riva` is available in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/nemo2riva/).

Once the model is deployed as a Riva NIM, you can issue inference requests to the server. We will demonstrate how quick and straightforward this whole process is.\n",

The standard encryption key for the older pre-trained models is `tlt_encode`.\n",

    "3. If your language model is in the `.binary` format, replace `/servicemaker-dev/$LANGUAGE_MODEL_NAME:$KEY` with `--decoding_language_model_binary=/servicemaker-dev/$LANGUAGE_MODEL_NAME` when invoking `riva-build`.\n",
    "4. Refer to the [Riva ASR NIM Pipeline Configuration documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/riva/asr/latest/pipeline-configuration.html) if you want to build an ASR NIM.
