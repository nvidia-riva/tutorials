    "\n",
    "- The ``prosody`` tag, which supports attributes ``rate``, ``pitch`` and ``volume``, through which we can control the rate, pitch and volume of the generated audio.  \n",

    "- The ``phoneme`` tag, which allows us to control the pronunciation of the generated audio.\n",

    "#### Pitch Attribute\n",
    "Riva supports an additive relative change to the pitch. The `pitch` attribute has a range of [-3, 3]. Values outside this range result in an error being logged and no audio returned. This value returns a pitch shift of the attribute value multiplied with the speaker’s pitch standard deviation when the FastPitch model is trained. For the pretrained checkpoint that was trained on LJSpeech, the standard deviation was 52.185. For example, a pitch shift of 1.25 results in a change of 1.25*52.185=~65.23Hz pitch shift up. \n",
    "Riva also supports the prosody tags as per the SSML specs. Prosody tags `x-low`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `x-high`, and `default` are supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pitch` attribute is expressed in the following formats:\n",
    "- `pitch=\"1\"`\n",

    "- `pitch=\"high\"`\n",
    "- `pitch=\"default\"`\n",

    "For the pretrained Female-1 checkpoint, the standard deviation is 53.33 Hz.\n",
    "For the pretrained Male-1 checkpoint, the standard deviation is 47.15 Hz.\n",

    "The `pitch` attribute does not support `Hz`, `st`, and `%` changes. Support is planned for a future Riva release.\n",

    "Riva supports a percentage relative change to the rate. The `rate` attribute has a range of [25%, 250%]. Values outside this range result in an error being logged and no audio returned. \n",
