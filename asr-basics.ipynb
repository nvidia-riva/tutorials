    "- `sample_rate_hertz` - Sampling rate of the input audio in Hz. Note that the sample rate can be detected automatically from the audio `.wav` file and resampled if needed, making this parameter optional.\n",

    "- `max_alternatives` - Determines the number of top alternative transcriptions to return\n",
    "- `enable_automatic_punctuation` - Adds a punctuation at the end of VAD (Voice Activity Detection).\n",

The Docker images can also be removed, however, you’ll be asked for confirmation before removal.\n",

    "    \n",
