    "- Automated speech recognition (ASR)\n",
    "- Text-to-Speech synthesis (TTS)\n",
    "- A collection of natural language processing (NLP) services, such as named entity recognition (NER), punctuation, and intent classification.\n",

Once the model is deployed in Riva, you can issue inference requests to the server. We will demonstrate how quick and straightforward this whole process is.\n",
