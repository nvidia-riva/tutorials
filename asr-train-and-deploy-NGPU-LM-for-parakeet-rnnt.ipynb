    "## Understanding N-gram Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are crucial components in automatic speech recognition systems, helping to improve accuracy by incorporating linguistic knowledge. There are two primary approaches to language modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "### N-gram Language Models\n",
    "**N-gram models** are statistical language models that predict the next word based on the previous `n-1` words. They work by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Frequency Analysis**: Learning probability distributions from word sequence frequencies in training data\n",
    "- **Context Window**: Using a fixed context window of `n` words to make predictions\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Providing fast inference with predictable computational requirements\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Offering a clear space-time tradeoff - larger `n` values capture more context but require more memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simple and interpretable\n",
    "- Fast inference and training\n",
    "- Well-understood mathematical foundation\n",
    "- Excellent for domain-specific applications\n",
    "- Low computational overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neural Language Models\n",
    "**Neural language models** use deep learning architectures (RNNs, Transformers, etc.) to model language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Superior Performance**: Generally achieve better language modeling capabilities\n",
    "- **Context Awareness**: Can capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns\n",
    "- **Computational Cost**: Require more computational resources for training and inference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why N-gram Models for ASR?\n",
    "For speech recognition applications, n-gram models offer several practical advantages:\n",
    "- **Real-time Performance**: Fast enough for streaming ASR applications\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: Lower memory and computational requirements\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Easy to retrain on domain-specific data\n",
    "- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing ASR pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll train a 6-gram language model using the KenLM toolkit integrated with NeMo, then deploy it as an N-GPU Language Model in NVIDIA Riva NIM for production use.\n",

    "## Riva ServiceMaker Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "**Riva ServiceMaker** is a comprehensive toolkit that streamlines the deployment of custom models to NVIDIA Riva NIM. It handles the complex process of aggregating all necessary artifacts for production deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ServiceMaker Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Riva ServiceMaker consists of two main tools that work together to create a complete deployment pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Riva-Build\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Creates deployment-ready model pipelines\n",
    "- **Input**: `.riva` model files and configuration\n",
    "- **Output**: `.rmir` (Riva Model Intermediate Representation) files\n",
    "- **Function**: Combines models, configurations, and optimizations into a single deployable package\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Riva-Deploy\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Deploys the pipeline to target environments\n",
    "- **Input**: `.rmir` files and deployment configuration\n",
    "- **Output**: Complete model repository ready for NIM deployment\n",
    "- **Function**: Creates the final deployment package with all necessary artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Overview\n",
    "1. **Model Preparation**: Convert models to `.riva` format\n",
    "2. **Pipeline Building**: Use `riva-build` to create `.rmir` files\n",
    "3. **Deployment**: Use `riva-deploy` to create the final model repository\n",
    "4. **NIM Deployment**: Deploy the repository to NVIDIA NIM\n",
    "\n",

    "#### What Riva-Build Does\n",
    "- **Model Integration**: Combines multiple `.riva` model files into a unified pipeline\n",
    "- **Configuration Management**: Applies deployment-specific configurations and optimizations\n",
    "- **Asset Aggregation**: Collects all necessary files, dependencies, and metadata\n",
    "- **Pipeline Creation**: Generates a complete end-to-end inference pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output: RMIR Files\n",
    "The primary output is an **RMIR (Riva Model Intermediate Representation)** file that contains:\n",
    "- **Pipeline Specification**: Complete end-to-end inference workflow\n",
    "- **Model Assets**: All model files, weights, and configurations\n",
    "- **Deployment Metadata**: Hardware requirements, optimization settings\n",
    "- **Service Configuration**: API endpoints, input/output specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For ASR with N-gram Language Models\n",
    "In our case, `riva-build` will:\n",
    "1. **Combine Models**: Integrate the Parakeet RNNT acoustic model with our n-gram language model\n",
    "2. **Configure Pipeline**: Set up the complete ASR pipeline with language model integration\n",
    "3. **Optimize Performance**: Apply optimizations for the target deployment environment\n",
    "4. **Generate RMIR**: Create the intermediate representation ready for deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Benefits\n",
    "- **Deployment Agnostic**: RMIR files work across different deployment environments\n",
    "- **Optimized Performance**: Includes hardware-specific optimizations\n",
    "- **Complete Pipeline**: Contains everything needed for end-to-end inference\n",
    "- **Easy Deployment**: Simplifies the final deployment step\n",
