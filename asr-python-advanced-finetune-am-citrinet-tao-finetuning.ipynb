TAO enables developers, researchers, and software partners with limited AI expertise to create highly accurate AI models for production deployments. TAO follows zero coding paradigm where there is no need to write any code to train models. Training can be done by simply running a few commands with the TAO command-line interface."

    "Before we can do the actual training, we need to pre-process the text. This step is called subword tokenization that creates a subword vocabulary for the text. This is different from Jasper/QuartzNet because only single characters are regarded as elements in the vocabulary in their cases, while in Citrinet the subword can be one or multiple characters. We can use the `create_tokenizer` command to create the tokenizer that generates the subword vocabulary for us for use in training."
