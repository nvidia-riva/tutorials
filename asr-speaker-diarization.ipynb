    "## Speaker Diarization with Riva ASR APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "[Speaker Diarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_diarisation) is the process of segmenting audio recordings by speaker labels and aims to answer the question “who spoke when?” Riva ASR supports speaker diarization, which can be enabled by passing [`SpeakerDiarizationConfig`](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/reference/protos/protos.html#_CPPv424SpeakerDiarizationConfig) with `enable_speaker_diarization` set to `True`. Riva speaker diarization segments input audio, extracts speaker embeddings of the segments, counts the number of speakers, and then assigns each audio segment a corresponding speaker tag. When speaker diarization is enabled, Riva ASR returns the ASR transcript to the client, along with a speaker tag for each word in the transcript. Speaker diarization is language agnostic and can work with any language supported by Riva ASR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note:\n",
    "Speaker diarization is only supported with Riva ASR offline API. Speaker diarization is an alpha release and will increase ASR latency once the feature is enabled. Refer to [Performance](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/asr/asr-performance.html) for more information."
