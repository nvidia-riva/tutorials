    "# What are Adapters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapters are trainable neural network modules that are attached to pretrained models, such that we freeze the weights of the original model and only train the adapter parameters. This reduces the amount of data required to customize a model substantially, while imposing the limitation that the model's vocabulary cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adapter modules form a residual bridge over the output of each layer they adapt, such that the model's original performance is not lost. \n",
    "- The original parameters of the model are frozen in their entirety, so that we can recover the original model by disabling all adapters.\n",
    "- We train only the new adapter parameters (an insignificant fraction of the total number of parameters). This allows fast experimentation with very little data and compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapters are a straightforward concept, as shown in the following diagram. At their simplest, they are residual Feedforward layers that compress the input dimension ($D$) to a small bottleneck dimension ($H$), such that $R^D \\text{->} R^H$, compute an activation (such as ReLU), finally mapping $R^H \\text{->} R^D$ with another Feedforward layer. This output is then added to the input through a residual connection.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are very few differences between fine-tuning and adapter training with respect to the preparation of the model, data loaders, or optimization method.\n",
    "\n",
    "One significant difference is that there is no need to change the vocabulary of the pre-trained network, therefore, there is no need to construct a new tokenizer or update the character vocabulary. If your customization dataset contains tokens that requires such changes (for example tokens that don't exist in the model), then you will need to either preprocess the text to remove such tokens, or instead perform fine-tuning (which may require substantially more data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another minor difference is the use of spectrogram augmentation (SpecAugment). During fine-tuning, the amount of data is very little compared to when the model was pre-trained with thousands of hours of speech, so SpecAugment may have been used to prevent overfitting. For adapters, we recommend first disabling spec augmentation and trying to see if results are good enough, then adding it back slowly, as needed, to see if any improvements can be obtained.\n",
