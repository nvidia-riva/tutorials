    "- Automated speech recognition (ASR)\n",

    "## Speech generation with Riva TTS APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "The Riva TTS service is based on a two-stage pipeline: Riva first generates a mel spectrogram using the first model, then generates speech using the second model. This pipeline forms a text-to-speech system that enables you to synthesize natural sounding speech from raw transcripts without any additional information such as patterns or rhythms of speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Riva provides two state-of-the-art voices (one male and one female) for English, that can easily be deployed with the Riva Quick Start scripts. Riva also supports easy customization of TTS in various ways, to meet your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsequent Riva releases will include added features, including model registration to support multiple languages/voices with the same API. Support for resampling to alternative sampling rates will also be added.\n",

    "- ``language_code`` - Language of the generated audio. ``\"en-US\"`` represents English (US) and is currently the only language supported OOTB.\n",
    "- ``encoding`` - Type of audio encoding to generate (``LINEAR_PCM``, ``FLAC``, ``MULAW`` and ``ALAW``).\n",
    "- ``sample_rate_hz`` - Sample rate of the generated audio. Depends on the microphone and is usually ``22khz`` or ``44khz``.\n",
