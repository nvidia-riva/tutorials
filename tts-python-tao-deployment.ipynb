    "[Train Adapt Optimize (TAO) Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/tao-toolkit) provides the capability to export your model in a format that can be deployed using [NVIDIA Riva](https://developer.nvidia.com/riva), a highly performant application framework for multi-modal conversational AI services using GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explores taking 2 `.riva models`, the result of `tao spectro_gen` and `tao vocoder` commands, and leveraging the Riva ServiceMaker framework to aggregate all the necessary artifacts for the Riva deployment to a target environment. Once the models are deployed in Riva, you can issue inference requests to the server. We will demonstrate how quick and straightforward this whole process is.\n",

    "---\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:  \n",
    "- use Riva ServiceMaker to take a TAO exported .riva and convert it to .rmir.\n",
    "- deploy the model(s) locally on the Riva server.\n",
    "- send inference requests from a demo client using Riva API bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow along, ensure you:\n",
    "- have access to NVIDIA NGC and are able to download the Riva Quick Start [resources](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/resources/nvidia:riva:riva_quickstart)\n",
    "- have a `.riva` model file that you want to deploy. You can obtain this from `tao <task> export` (with `export_format=RIVA`). Refer to the [Text to Speech tutorial](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/resources/texttospeech_notebook) on Speech Synthesis using Train Adapt Optimize (TAO) Toolkit for more details on training and exporting a `.riva` model."
