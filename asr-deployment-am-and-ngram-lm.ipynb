    "1. If you encrypted your acoustic model and/or language model by adding the `--key` flag when invoking `nemo2riva`, or you downloaded a pre-trained model from NGC dated before 2023, you'll need to append a colon and then the key's value to the model's name in the `riva-build` command, as shown below. You might find it convenient to set a string variable named `KEY` and pass it into the appropriate `riva-build` arguments as `$KEY`. The standard encryption key for the older pre-trained models is `tlt_encode`.\n",
    "2. If your language model is in the `.arpa` format, replace `/servicemaker-dev/$LANGUAGE_MODEL_NAME:$KEY` with `--decoding_language_model_arpa=/servicemaker-dev/$LANGUAGE_MODEL_NAME` when invoking `riva-build`.\n",
    "3. If your language model is in the `.binary` format, replace `/servicemaker-dev/$LANGUAGE_MODEL_NAME:$KEY` with `--decoding_language_model_binary=/servicemaker-dev/$LANGUAGE_MODEL_NAME` when invoking `riva-build`.\n",
    "4. If you obtained your `.riva`-formatted acoustic model or language model file from `tao <task> export`, you may need to replace `--nn.fp16_needs_obey_precision_pass` with `--nn.use_trt_fp32` when invoking `riva-build`. \n",
    "5. Refer to the [Riva ASR Pipeline Configuration documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/asr/asr-pipeline-configuration.html) if you want to build an ASR pipeline for a supported language other than US English. To obtain the proper `riva-build` parameters for your particular application, select the acoustic model (the parameters below assume Conformer-CTC), language, and pipeline type (offline for the purposes of this tutorial) from the interactive web menu at the bottom of the first section of the page.
