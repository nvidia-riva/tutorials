# How to Deploy Riva at Scale on AWS with EKS

This is an example of deploying and scaling Riva Speech Skills on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
with Traefik-based load balancing. It includes the following steps:
1. Creating the EKS cluster
2. Deploying the Riva API service
3. Deploying the Traefik edge router
4. Creating the IngressRoute to handle incoming requests
5. Deploying a sample client
6. Scaling the cluster

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, ensure you have:
- An AWS account with the appropriate user/role privileges to manage [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)
- The AWS command-line tool, [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) for your account
- Access to [NGC](https://ngc.nvidia.com/signin) and the associated [command-line](https://docs.ngc.nvidia.com/cli/) interface
- Cluster management tools [`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/), [`helm`](https://helm.sh/) and [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/)

This sample has been tested on: `eksctl` (v0.82.0), `helm` (v3.6.3), `kubectl` (v1.21.2), and `traefik` (v2.5.3).

## Creating the EKS Cluster

The cluster contains three separate nodegroups:
- `gpu-linux-workers`: A GPU-equipped node where the main Riva service runs. `g5.2xlarge` instances, each using an A10 GPU, provide good value and sufficient capacity for many applications. This nodegroup allows scaling from 1 to 8 nodes.
- `cpu-linux-lb`: A general-purpose compute node for the Traefik load balancer, using an `m6i.large` instance.
- `cpu-linux-clients`: Another general-purpose node with an `m6i.2xlarge` instance, for client applications accessing the Riva service. The node is used for benchmarking in this example, or could also be used for another service such as a `node.js` application.

1. Build a configuration that defines each of these nodegroups and save it to a file called `eks_launch_conf.yaml`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
    kind: ClusterConfig

    metadata:
      name: riva-cluster
      region: us-west-2
      version: "1.21"

    iam:
      withOIDC: true

    managedNodeGroups:
      - name: gpu-linux-workers
        labels: { role: workers }
        instanceType: g5.2xlarge
        minSize: 1
        maxSize: 8
        volumeSize: 100
        privateNetworking: true
        ssh:
          allow: true
      - name: cpu-linux-lb
        labels: { role: loadbalancers }
        instanceType: m6i.large
        desiredCapacity: 1
        volumeSize: 100
        privateNetworking: true
        ssh:
          allow: true
      - name: cpu-linux-clients
        labels: { role: clients }
        instanceType: m6i.2xlarge
        desiredCapacity: 1
        volumeSize: 100
        privateNetworking: true
        ssh:
          allow: true
    ```

2. Launch the cluster with the above configuration.

    ```bash
    eksctl create cluster -f eks_launch_conf.yaml
    ```

    This may take 30 minutes or more for AWS to provision all the necessary resources. When complete, you should see some changes in your default Kubernetes configuration file.

3. Verify that the nodes now appear in Kubernetes. If so, the cluster was successfully created.

    ```bash
    cat .kube/config
    kubectl get pods -A
    kubectl get nodes --show-labels
    kubectl get nodes --selector role=workers
    kubectl get nodes --selector role=clients
    kubectl get nodes --selector role=loadbalancers
    ```

## Deploying the Riva API

The Riva Speech Skills Helm chart is designed to automate deployment to a Kubernetes cluster. After downloading the Helm chart, minor adjustments will adapt the chart to the way Riva will be used in the remainder of this tutorial.

1.  Download and untar the Riva API Helm chart. Replace `VERSION_TAG` with the specific version needed.

    ```bash
    export NGC_CLI_API_KEY=<your NGC API key>
    export VERSION_TAG="{VersionNum}"
    helm fetch https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia/riva/charts/riva-api-${VERSION_TAG}.tgz --username='$oauthtoken' --password=$NGC_CLI_API_KEY
    tar -xvzf riva-api-${VERSION_TAG}.tgz
    ```

2.  In the `riva-api` folder, modify the following files:

    1. **`values.yaml`**

        * Set `riva.speechServices.[asr,nlp,tts]` to `true` or `false` as needed to enable or disable those services. For example, if only ASR is needed, then set the NLP and TTS values to `false`.
        * In `modelRepoGenerator.ngcModelConfigs.[asr,nlp,tts]`, comment or uncomment specific models or languages as needed.
        * Change `service.type` from `LoadBalancer` to `ClusterIP`. This directly exposes the service only to other services within the cluster, such as the proxy service to be installed below.

    2. **`templates/deployment.yaml`**

        * Add a node selector constraint to ensure that Riva is only deployed on the correct GPU resources. In `spec.template.spec`, add:

          ```yaml
          nodeSelector:
            eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup: gpu-linux-workers
          ```

3. Enable the cluster to run containers needing NVIDIA GPUs using the nvidia device plugin:

    ```bash
    helm repo add nvdp https://nvidia.github.io/k8s-device-plugin
    helm repo update
    helm install \
        --generate-name \
        --set failOnInitError=false \
        nvdp/nvidia-device-plugin
    ```

4. Ensure you are in a working directory with `riva-api` as a subdirectory, then install the Riva Helm chart. You can explicitly override variables from the `values.yaml` file, such as the `riva.speechServices.[asr,nlp,tts]` settings.

    ```bash
    helm install riva-api riva-api/ \
        --set ngcCredentials.password=`echo -n $NGC_CLI_API_KEY | base64 -w0` \
        --set modelRepoGenerator.modelDeployKey=`echo -n tlt_encode | base64 -w0` \
        --set riva.speechServices.asr=true \
        --set riva.speechServices.nlp=true \
        --set riva.speechServices.tts=true
    ```

5. The Helm chart runs two containers in order: a `riva-model-init` container that downloads and deploys the models, followed by a `riva-speech-api` container to start the speech service API. Depending on the number of models, the initial model deployment could take an hour or more. To monitor the deployment, use `kubectl` to describe the `riva-api` pod and to watch the container logs.
    ```bash
    export pod=`kubectl get pods | cut -d " " -f 1 | grep riva-api`
    kubectl describe pod $pod

    kubectl logs -f $pod -c riva-model-init
    kubectl logs -f $pod -c riva-speech-api
    ```

## Deploying the Traefik edge router

Now that the Riva service is running, the cluster needs a mechanism to route requests into Riva.

If the `service.type` is set to `LoadBalancer` in the `values.yaml` of the `riva-api` Helm chart, this would have automatically created an AWS Classic Load Balancer to direct traffic into the Riva service. Instead, the open-source [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) edge router will serve this purpose.

1.  Download and untar the Traefik Helm chart.

    ```bash
    helm repo add traefik https://helm.traefik.io/traefik
    helm repo update
    helm fetch traefik/traefik
    tar -zxvf traefik-*.tgz
    ```

2.  Modify the `traefik/values.yaml` file.

    1. Set `service.type` to `LoadBalancer` to expose the service on a external IP accessible from outside the cluster.
    If the `service.type` is set to `ClusterIP`, the service will only be exposed on a cluster-internal IP.

    2. Set `nodeSelector` to `{ eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup: cpu-linux-lb }`. Similar to what you did for the Riva API service,
    this tells the Traefik service to run on the `cpu-linux-lb` nodegroup.

3.  Deploy the modified `traefik` Helm chart.
    ```bash
    helm install traefik traefik/
    ```

## Creating the IngressRoute

  An [IngressRoute](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/) enables the Traefik load balancer to
  recognize incoming requests and distribute them across multiple `riva-api` services.

  If you deployed the above `traefik` Helm chart with `service.type` set to `ClusterIP`, Kubernetes automatically created a local DNS entry for that service: `traefik.default.svc.cluster.local`. If you deployed the above `traefik` Helm chart with `service.type` set to `LoadBalancer`, Kubernetes automatically created an external DNS entry for that service which can be obtained from `kubectl get svc` command, e.g. `a7153b60c6e7a44dab6f681d15e111b5-2140342794.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com`.

  The IngressRoute definition below matches these DNS entries and directs requests to the `riva-api` service. You can modify the entries to support a different DNS arrangement, depending on your requirements.

  1. Create the following `riva-ingress.yaml` file. You need to replace `<local_or_external_IP>` with the local or external DNS entry mentioned in the above instruction.

      ```yaml
      apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
      kind: IngressRoute
      metadata:
        name: riva-ingressroute
      spec:
        entryPoints:
          - web
        routes:
          - match: "Host(`<local_or_external_IP>`)"
            kind: Rule
            services:
              - name: riva-api
                port: 50051
                scheme: h2c
      ```

  2. Deploy the IngressRoute.
      ```bash
      kubectl apply -f riva-ingress.yaml
      ```

The Riva service is now able to serve gRPC requests from within or outside the cluster, depending on the `service.type` field, at the local or external address as mentioned before. If you are planning to deploy your own client application in the cluster to communicate with Riva, you can send requests to that address. In the next section, you will deploy a Riva sample client and use it to test the deployment.

## Deploying a Sample Client

Riva provides a container with a set of pre-built sample clients to test the Riva services. The [Riva C++ clients](https://github.com/nvidia-riva/cpp-clients) and [Riva Python clients](https://github.com/nvidia-riva/python-clients) are also available on GitHub for those interested in adapting them.

1.  Create the `client-deployment.yaml` file that defines the deployment and contains the following:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: riva-client
      labels:
        app: "rivaasrclient"
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: "rivaasrclient"
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: "rivaasrclient"
        spec:
          nodeSelector:
              eks.amazonaws.com/nodegroup: cpu-linux-clients
          imagePullSecrets:
          - name: imagepullsecret
          containers:
          - name: riva-client
            image: "nvcr.io/{NgcOrgTeam}/riva-speech:{VersionNum}"
            command: ["/bin/bash"]
            args: ["-c", "while true; do sleep 5; done"]
    ```
2.  Deploy the client service.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f client-deployment.yaml
    ```

3.  Connect to the client pod.
    ```bash
    export cpod=`kubectl get pods | cut -d " " -f 1 | grep riva-client`
    kubectl exec --stdin --tty $cpod /bin/bash
    ```

4.  From inside the shell of the client pod, run the sample ASR client on an example `.wav` file. Specify the `<local_or_external_IP>` endpoint as mentioned before, with port 80, as the service address.
    ```bash
    riva_streaming_asr_client \
       --audio_file=/opt/riva/wav/en-US_sample.wav \
       --automatic_punctuation=true \
       --riva_uri=<local_or_external_IP>:80
    ```

## Scaling the cluster

As deployed above, the EKS cluster only provisions a single GPU node, although the given configuration permits up to 8 nodes. While a single GPU can handle a [large volume of requests](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/riva/user-guide/docs/asr/asr-performance.html), the cluster can easily be scaled with more nodes.

1. Scale the GPU nodegroup to the desired number of compute nodes (4 in this case).
    ```bash
    eksctl scale nodegroup \
      --name=gpu-linux-workers \
      --cluster=riva-cluster \
      --nodes=4 \
      --region=us-west-2
    ```

2. Scale the `riva-api` deployment to use the additional nodes.
    ```bash
    kubectl scale deployments/riva-api --replicas=4
    ```

As with the original `riva-api` deployment, each replica pod downloads and initializes the necessary models prior to starting the Riva service.
