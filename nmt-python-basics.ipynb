    "## Introduction to Language Translation with Riva NMT\n",
    "\n",
    "Riva Neural machine translation (NMT) is a framework for machine translation based on neural networks. NMT translates text between language pairs, that is, from one language to another. For example, we want a machine to translate text in one language (we call this the source language), to corresponding text in another language (we call this the target language).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Riva NMT EA offers multiple models for Machine Translation. These models fall into two model architectures:\n",
    "1. **Multilingual models** support translating from one source language to multiple target languages or vice-versa. For example, the `mnmt_en_deesfr_transformer24x6` model can be used to translate from English to German, Spanish, and French. Multilingual models have several language codes in their name. Use a multilingual model if you need to support multiple languages or if you want to optimize resource utlization since you can translate along multiple language pairs without loading multiple models. Running multilingual models prevents loading multiple models, therefore, preventing overhead. By default, use 24x6 multilingual models. You can use 12x2 instead of a 24x6 multilingual model if you need to reduce the resource consumption even further and can accept a bit of translation quality degradation.  \n",
    "Please note that Multilingual models will be added to Riva NMT EA in a future release.\n",
    "2. **Bilingual models** are used for translation from one source language to another target language. For example, the `en_de_24x6` model can be used to translate from English to Russian. Bilingual models have a single pair of language codes in their name. Use a bilingual model when you want the best possible performance for a specific language pair direction. Running bilingual models produces faster results compared to running multilingual models. \n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Riva NMT, refer to the Riva NMT EA documentation.  \n",
    "For more information about the NMT model architecture and training, refer to the [NeMo NMT documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/machine_translation.html)."

The changes in climate are not expected to be uniform across the Earth. In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the tropics.

    "The effects of climate change span the impacts on physical environment, ecosystems and human societies due to ongoing human-caused climate change. The future impact of climate change depends on how much nations reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Effects that scientists predicted in the past—loss of sea ice, accelerated sea level rise and longer, more intense heat waves—are now occurring. The changes in climate are not expected to be uniform across the Earth. In particular, land areas change more quickly than oceans, and northern high latitudes change more quickly than the tropics. There are three major ways in which global warming will make changes to regional climate: melting ice, changing the hydrological cycle (of evaporation and precipitation) and changing currents in the oceans.\n",
    "Physical changes include extreme weather, glacier retreat, sea level rise, declines in Arctic sea ice, and changes in the timing of seasonal events (such as earlier spring flowering). Since 1970, the ocean has absorbed more than 90% of the excess heat in the climate system. Even if global surface temperature is stabilized, sea levels will continue to rise and the ocean will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere for many centuries. The uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is leading to ocean acidification.\n",
    "Climate change has degraded land by raising temperatures, drying soils and increasing wildfire risk. Recent warming has strongly affected natural biological systems. Species worldwide are migrating poleward to colder areas. On land, species move to higher elevations, whereas marine species find colder water at greater depths. Between 1% and 50% of species on land were assessed to be at substantially higher risk of extinction due to climate change. Coral reefs and shellfish are vulnerable to the combined threat of ocean warming and acidification.\n",
    "Food security and access to fresh water are at risk due to rising temperatures. Climate change has profound impacts on human health, directly via heat stress and indirectly via the spread of infectious diseases.\n",
