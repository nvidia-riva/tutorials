## Requirements and Setup

### Running the NVIDIA Riva Tutorials
This section covers the Requirements and Setup needed to run all Riva Tutorials, except:  
1. [How to improve accuracy on specific speech patterns by fine-tuning the Acoustic Model (Citrinet) in the Riva ASR pipeline](asr-python-advanced-finetune-am-citrinet-for-noisy-audio-withtao.ipynb): For the Requirements and Setup of this tutorial, please refer to this section.  


#### Requirements
Before you try running the NVIDIA Riva tutorials, ensure you meet the following requirements: 
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) 

#### Setup
1. Clone the NVIDIA Riva tutorials repository.  
``git clone https://github.com/nvidia-riva/tutorials.git``  
``cd tutorials``

2. Create a Python virtual environment - We will be using this virtual environment to install all the depencies needed for Riva tutorials.  
``python3 -m venv venv-riva-tutorials``

3. Activate the Python virtual environment we just created.  
``. venv-riva-tutorials/bin/activate``

4. Install Jupyter notebook.  
``pip3 install jupyter``  

5. Create an IPython kernel - The Riva tutorials Jupyter notebooks will be using this kernel in the next step.  
``ipython kernel install --user --name=venv-riva-tutorials``

6. Start the Jupyter notebooks server.  
``jupyter notebook --allow-root --port 8888``  
If you have a browser installed on your machine, the notebook should automatically open. If you do not have a browser, copy/paste the URL from the command.  
Once you open a Riva tutorial notebook on a browser, choose the `venv-riva-tutorials` kernel by `Kernel` -> `Change kernel` -> `venv-riva-tutorials`

### Running the NVIDIA Riva Tutorial "How to improve accuracy on specific speech patterns by fine-tuning the Acoustic Model (Citrinet) in the Riva ASR pipeline"

#### Requirements  
Before you try running this NVIDIA Riva tutorials, ensure you meet the following requirements: 
- docker 

#### Setup  
1. Clone NVIDIA NeMo repository.  
``git clone -b main https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git``

2. Clone the NVIDIA Riva tutorials repository.  
``git clone https://github.com/nvidia-riva/tutorials.git``  
``cd tutorials``  

3. Pull and run NVIDIA NeMo container.  
``docker run -it --rm -v <nemo_github_folder>:/NeMo -v $PWD:/tutorials --net=host nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.04-py3``  
``cd /tutorials``  

4. Install ffmpeg library.  
``apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg``  

5. Start the Jupyter notebooks server.  
``jupyter notebook --allow-root --port 8888``  
If you have a browser installed on your machine, the notebook should automatically open. If you do not have a browser, copy/paste the URL from the command.  


### Running the Riva Client

#### Requirements
Before you try running the Riva client, ensure you meet the following requirements: 
- You have access and are logged into NVIDIA NGC. For step-by-step instructions, refer to the [NGC Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-overview/index.html#registering-activating-ngc-account).
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) 

#### Setup
1. Download the Riva Quick Start scripts, if not already done.  
``ngc registry resource download-version "nvidia/riva/riva_quickstart:2.0.0"``

2. [Optional] If using the `venv-riva-tutorials` (or another) Python virtual environment, activate it.  
``. <Python virtual environment directory location>/venv-riva-tutorials/bin/activate``

3. Install the Riva client library.  
``cd riva_quickstart_v2.0.0``  
``pip install riva_api-2.0.0-py3-none-any.whl``
